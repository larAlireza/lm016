# Arduino Project with LM016L LCD Display

This project demonstrates the wiring and setup of an LM016L LCD display with an Arduino Uno. The schematic, created in Proteus, shows the connections required to interface the LCD with the Arduino, as well as a potentiometer to adjust the display contrast.

# Components
  Arduino Uno: Acts as the microcontroller to manage input and output.
  LM016L LCD: A 16x2 LCD display used to show textual output from the Arduino.
  Potentiometer: Adjusts the contrast of the LCD display.
# About the LM016L LCD
The LM016L is a 16x2 LCD, meaning it can display up to 16 characters per line across two lines. It utilizes a standard HD44780 controller, making it compatible with most Arduino LCD libraries. By connecting the LM016L to the Arduino, you can display characters, numbers, and basic symbols, which makes it useful for projects that require a user interface or simple feedback.

# Wiring Diagram
Vcc and GND: Connect to the Arduinoâ€™s 5V and ground pins, respectively.
RS, E, D4-D7: Connect these pins to the corresponding Arduino pins as shown in the schematic.
Potentiometer: Adjusts the voltage on the Vo pin of the LCD, controlling contrast.
